# Best Dolphin Anty Browser Alternative for Multi-Accounting

## Why Is AdsPower a Better Alternative to Dolphin Anty?

Both AdsPower and Dolphin Anty are excellent multi-login browsers for affiliate marketing and online advertising. However, AdsPower offers several unique advantages that make it a better choice for managing multiple accounts efficiently and securely.

### Advanced & Secure Protection

All your accounts logged in via AdsPower are protected with advanced encryption techniques, including two-factor authentication, storage & transmission encryption, and more. The Team Management tool also enables precise permission settings to reduce the risk of account leakage.
