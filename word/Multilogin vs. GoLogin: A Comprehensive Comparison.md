## Built-in Proxies

**Multilogin** provides unmatched control over proxies, featuring:
- Built-in residential proxies covering over 150 countries.
- Super-sticky IP sessions lasting up to 24 hours.
- Bandwidth rollover and an IP quality filter for optimal performance.

**GoLogin**, designed for simplicity, offers a mix of datacenter, residential, and mobile proxies. Its proxy pool includes around 10,000 IP addresses across 78 countries, but lacks the advanced control features provided by Multilogin.

## Usability and User Interface

**Multilogin** ensures an easy-to-use interface with quick access to browser profiles, settings, and customer support. The Mimic (Chromium-based) and Stealthfox (Firefox-based) browsers provide a familiar and intuitive browsing experience.

**GoLogin** also offers a clean interface, but some important features are nested under multiple menus, making navigation less efficient compared to Multilogin.

## Browser Fingerprinting Customization

**Multilogin** offers advanced spoofing capabilities, allowing users to mimic any operating system, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. Its fingerprinting technology ensures resistance to browser detection.

**GoLogin** provides basic fingerprinting options by creating unique profiles. However, it restricts some devices to specific fingerprints (e.g., Windows devices must use Windows fingerprints), which makes it less versatile.

---

## Browser Flexibility

**Multilogin** provides two browsers:
- **Mimic**, based on Chromium.
- **Stealthfox**, based on Firefox.

This dual-browser offering allows users to switch browsers seamlessly and resolve compatibility issues efficiently.

**GoLogin** only offers **Orbita**, a Chromium-based browser. The absence of a Firefox-based browser limits its flexibility compared to Multilogin.

---

## Customer Support

**Multilogin** excels in customer support with a 24/7 multilingual team fluent in English, Vietnamese, Russian, Chinese, and Portuguese. The support team regularly tests the platform across 50+ websites to ensure high performance.

**GoLogin** offers live chat support but lacks the technical expertise and promptness of Multilogin’s support team.

---

## Performance

**Multilogin** stands out for its stability and advanced browser fingerprinting control. The Mimic and Stealthfox browsers perform exceptionally well in maintaining anonymity and handling multiple profiles.

**GoLogin** offers faster browsing speeds but struggles with managing multiple profiles on low-powered devices. Its detection issues often stem from user behavior and proxy quality.
